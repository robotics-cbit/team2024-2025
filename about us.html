        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p><strong>The Robotics and Innovation Club</strong> of Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT) was established in 2011 with a mission to explore and advance the field of robotics from its fundamental principles. Our club is dedicated to fostering innovation and creativity among the young minds of CBIT by conducting a variety of workshops, sessions, and hands-on activities.</p>
        <p>As a community of enthusiastic learners and creators, our members actively participate in inter-college events, where we've proudly won medals at some of the most prestigious national institutions. Our commitment to excellence in robotics has led to the initiation of our own national-level robotics fest, <strong>Robovanza</strong>. This event has drawn participation from students across India, making it a landmark event for robotics enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>Beyond robotics, our club has successfully undertaken various research and development (R&D) projects. We're also expanding our horizons by engaging in multidisciplinary activities, sparking interest in diverse fields and encouraging holistic development among our members.</p>
        <p>Join us as we continue to push the boundaries of innovation and technology, making CBIT a hub for robotics and multidisciplinary exploration.</p>
