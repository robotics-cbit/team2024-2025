                <p>A <strong>Self-Balancing Robot </strong> is a type of two-wheeled robot designed to maintain an upright position through active control mechanisms. It uses sensors, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers, to detect its tilt and adjusts its motors in real-time to prevent falling. 

                    The robot operates on the principle of an inverted pendulum, where the center of mass is above the pivot point, making it inherently unstable. To achieve balance, it employs a closed-loop feedback control system, often utilizing Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers.
                    
                    Self-balancing robots have various applications, including personal transport devices like Segways, service robots for navigation, and educational tools for teaching robotics and control systems. They exemplify advanced engineering concepts and provide insights into robotics and automation.</p>
